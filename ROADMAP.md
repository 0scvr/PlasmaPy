# PlasmaPy Development Roadmap

This document summarizes the overall development plans for PlasmaPy.
This roadmap is very fluid and is subject to change due to community
priorities.  For the most up-to-date information, see PlasmaPy's
[issues](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/issues), [pull
requests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/pulls), and
[projects](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/projects).

## Features to be included in Version 0.1 release
