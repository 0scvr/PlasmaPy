# A vision for an open source core Python package for plasma physics

## Overview

In recent years, researchers in many different scientific disciplines have worked together to develop core Python packages such as AstroPy, SunPy, and SpacePy.  These packages provide core functionality, common frameworks for data visualization and analysis, and educational tools.  We believe that a similar cooperatively developed package for plasma physics will greatly benefit our field.  In this document, we lay out our vision for PlasmaPy: a community developed and community driven core Python package for plasma physics.
