PlasmaPy Release Notes
======================

This document contains the release notes for each version of PlasmaPy.
A list of the changes for each version are included in the [change
log](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/master/CHANGE_LOG.md).

PlasmaPy uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), as described
in [PlasmaPy Enhancement Proposal (PLEP)
5](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-PLEPs/blob/master/PLEP-0005.md).
Version numbers are of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.  Development
releases have `MAJOR` equal to zero.  The [application programming
interface
(API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
during the development phase is unstable and anything may change at
any time.  Starting with version 1.0.0, `MAJOR` must be incremented
whenever the API changes in a way that is not backwards compatible,
`MINOR` must be incremented whenever the API expands while maintaining
backwards compatibility, and `PATCH` must be incremented for each bug
fix release.

Version 0.1.0 (2018-xx-xx)
--------------------------

We are pleased to announce the first development release of PlasmaPy:
a community-developed fully open source core Python package for plasma
physics.

Version 0.1.0 is a preview and a prototype, and is not feature
complete or recommended to be used for production work.  Significant
changes to the API are expected to occur between version 0.1.0 and
0.2.0.
