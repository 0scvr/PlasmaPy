            The bottom of this page includes several checks. Don't worry if something broke! We break stuff all the time. Clicking on *Details* next to each check will show the results, and why any checks failed. Please feel free to ask for help if you're having trouble (we do that all the time, as well). Some tips:

             - Try fixing Python 3.11 failures first.
            - Most *pre-commit.ci* failures can be automagically fixed by commenting \`pre-commit.ci autofix\` on this pull request, followed by a \`git pull\`
             - If the *CI/Documentation* check failed, our [documentation troubleshooting] has tips on deciphering [Sphinx] error messages.
