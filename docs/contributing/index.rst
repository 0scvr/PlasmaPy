Many ways to contribute
=======================

There are many ways to contribute to an open source project such as
PlasmaPy beyond contributing code. You can create educational notebooks
that introduce plasma concepts using PlasmaPy. You can

* `Request new features`_.
* `Report bugs`_.
* Write tutorials on how to use different PlasmaPy features.
* Create educational notebooks that introduce plasma concepts using PlasmaPy.
* Improve the project's documentation.
* Translate PlasmaPy's documentation into another language.
* Organize events such as `Plasma Hack Week`_.

Impostor syndrome disclaimer
============================

We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that
you're not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills
aren't nearly good enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a
project like this one?

We assure you: the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write
code at all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to
open source projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills.
Writing perfect code isn't the measure of a good developer (that would
disqualify all of us!); it's trying to create something, making
mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we all improve,
and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either.
You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving
feedback about the project (and yes â€” that includes giving feedback
about the contribution process). Some of these contributions may be the
most valuable to the project as a whole, because you're coming to the
project with fresh eyes, so you can see the errors and assumptions that
seasoned contributors have glossed over.
