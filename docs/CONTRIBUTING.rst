How to Contribute
=================

There are numerous ways to contribute to PlasmaPy, including by
providing code and documentation, suggesting and discussing ideas,
submitting issues and bug reports, and engaging the broader plasma
physics community.



Contributing code or documentation to PlasmaPy
----------------------------------------------

If you see something you’d like to work on amongst our
`issues <https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues>`_, start hacking
away on that! However, please announce your intent first in the relevant
issue to make sure there is no work duplication.

Please note that PlasmaPy has a :ref:`plasmapy-code-of-conduct`.

Issues marked by the community as *help wanted* mean just that - either
they’re good contributions for outsiders or there’s an issue in the
ongoing work that requires a second opinion. Please consider these
first!

Work on PlasmaPy is done via GitHub, so you’ll need a `(free)
account <https://github.com/join?source=header-home>`_. If you are new
to `git <https://git-scm.com>`_, helpful resources include
documentation on `git
basics <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`_
and an `interactive git
tutorial <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git>`_.
You must also `install
git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_
locally on your computer. We highly recommend getting reasonably
familiar with git by going through these tutorials or a `Software
Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org>`_ workshop prior to making
code contributions. Do note that you can usually find help in the
`PlasmaPy Matrix
chatroom <https://app.element.io/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org>`_.

For actual guidelines for working on PlasmaPy, please see our
|contributor guide|.

Towncrier changelog entries
---------------------------

Every pull request should include a changelog entry. Please see
:file:`changelog/README.rst` for instructions.

To summarize, put a file like ``<PULL REQUEST>.<TYPE>.rst``, where ``<PULL
REQUEST>`` is a pull request number, and ``<TYPE>`` is one of ``breaking``,
``feature``, ``bugfix``, ``doc``, ``removal``, ``trivial``. If unsure, ask
a maintainer.
