Collisions
**********

The `~plasmapy.physics.transport.collisions` subpackage includes a 
number of functions for handling Coulomb collisions spanning weakly 
coupled (low density) to strongly coupled (high density) regimes.

.. _Coulomb-collisions:

Coulomb collisions
==================

Explain, in general, what a Coulomb collision involves, when the model 
is useful, and the limitations of this model.

.. _Coulomb-logarithms:

Coulomb logarithms
==================

Explain the various methods available under Coulomb_logarithm.

.. _Collision-rates:

Collision rates
===============

Explain:
collision_frequency
Coulomb_cross_section
collision_rate_electron_ion
collision_rate_ion_ion
mean_free_path


.. _Macroscopic-properties:

Macroscopic properties
======================

These include:
Spitzer_resistivity
mobility
Knudsen_number
coupling_parameter
