# PlasmaPy

A community developed Python package for plasma physics.

## Project Status

PlasmaPy is in a very early stage of development.  The goals of this project are described in our [vision_statement](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/master/vision_statement.md) and an earlier conference poster:

* Murphy, Nicholas A, Huang, Yi-Min, & PlasmaPy Community. (2016, October). PlasmaPy: beginning a community developed Python package for plasma physics. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.163752

We recently created a guide on [contributing to PlasmaPy](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md), which also contains instructions on how to join our email list.  New contributors are very welcome!  

If you have any questions, please contact Nick Murphy at <namurphy@cfa.harvard.edu>, Yi-Min Huang at <yiminh@princeton.edu>, or Drew Leonard at <andy.j.leonard@gmail.com>.
